<h3> Instructions: </h3> 

<ol>

<!--<li> Ignore any notes that refer to shrike directories, or the animal
program. This first part of the assignment is the same, but all submissions
are to COL, and we will not use the animal data or learning program. -->

<li> All links are in the <a href=a2/program-agent.html> DIAgent Program </a>
assignment.<p>

<li> Download the java file for the Host Server and compile it. Run the server. Connect
to the server from a browser at port 1565. Repeat for two or three clients,
running concurrently. Follow the instructions posted on the browser, by the
server, to update the state of the various conversations. Cause some of the
agents to migrate to different ports. Refer to the execution instructions
for the Hostserver if needed.<p>


<!-- Here are the <a href=agent/dia/> HostServer class </a> files giving the
example framework we ran in class.<p> -->

John Reagan has provided updated code at <a
href=hostserver/HostServer-Reagan.java.txt> HostServer.java Reagan </a>. Thanks
also to James Raitsev that has a version with very excellent comments at <a
href=hostserver/HostServer-Raitsev.java.txt> HostServer.java Raitsev
</a> though this code may not work with all browsers. Get the HostServer
running on your local machine. Add your own comments to show that you know
how this works. To run, just issue "java HostServer" then start your
browser. Additionally here is the text version of the <a
href=agent/HostServer.text> Execution Instructions </a> for the
HostServer. The client is simply a web browser pointed to localhost:1565 to
start. (Yes, the DIA port may be different.) Here is code to <a
href=agent/getnext.html> get next available port
</a><p>

<!--
<li> Print the PDF file containing the source for the HostServer. Type in
the program code. Compile your own HostServer. Change the master server port
to 2525, and put in a server console statement about where it is
running. Run your own server. [Note: it is <i> intended </i> that you have
to type in the code from the PDF print file. Typing it in will help you to
learn what the program is doing and prepare you for the more challenging
full assignment. But, it is painless. Yes, it is possible to get around the
typing, but I <i> very much </i> do not recommend it, unless you are already
very strong in network, and thread, programming.]<p> -->

<li> Add your own comments to this pedagogical code (required!), to show
that you understand how it works.<p>

<li> The HostServer just uses a simple counter to get new ports for
agents. But code is provided to have the system find the next available
port. <i> Consider </i> rewriting your HostServer code to integrate the more
graceful code for getting new agent ports. But, this is not required.<p>

<!-- <li> The HostServer code does not calculate Content-Length. Depending on
your browser, you <i> might </i> actually have to calculate this to get the
data to appear.<p> -->

<li> Submit HostServer.java <strong> WITH YOUR COMMENTS </strong> to COL.<p>

<li> There is no checklist for this preliminary assignment.<p>

<li> Note: In this HostServer preliminary assignment, because we initiate
migration from the web client, we can migrate the agent, capture the new
address of the agent, install this in our dynamic HTML and
send it back to the client all as part of the one request-response step.
In this way the client always knows how to reach the migrated agent. <p>

In the larger assignment, the agent will migrate autonomously, and the
client will not know where it has gone. Thus we must leave behind a zombie,
to point to the new location when the client connects, or must maintain a
name-server that clients connect to, which then contacts the agent at its
currently location, or ...[fill in your own solution].<p>

<li> Note: In this HostServer preliminary assignment, to keep things simple,
the agents all run under the single HostServer. In the larger assignment we
will use multiple HostServer hosts (possibly running on different machines
at different IP addresses). However the code is virtually all the same. One
will simply have to replace the hard-coded address and port of the current
HostServer with some other HostServer IP address and port, and everything
else is handled by the current code.<p>
